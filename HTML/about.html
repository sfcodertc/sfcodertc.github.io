                        <p>This website was mainly for practice.</p>
                        <p>My name is Tyler, I'm 9 years old. I like developing games and making websites. <img src="../IMG/tylerphoto.jpg" id="tyler"></img></p>
                        <p>Which is why I made this.</p>
                        <p>I hope you figured out that you can click text that's white.</p>
                        <p>First is the <a href="../index.html">Home</a> tab, this is where you can go back to the main part of the website.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, there is a <a href="Game.html">Game</a> tab, this is the part where you can play games.</p>
                        <p>The only games are Snake and Pong. They both have the title and description so that you'll know how to play and what the game is called.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, the <a href="Challenges.html">Gallery</a> tab, keep note that this tab might be a bit buggy.</p>
                        <p>It's basically a gallery of acomplishments I did.</p>
                        <p>Some of the cool things I did was Gravity Simulation and Monte Carlo Simulation.</p>
